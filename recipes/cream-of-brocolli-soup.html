            <li><b>Onions and Celery</b>: Like so many great soups, this recipe starts with onions and celery. These veggies add complexity and depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Broth</b>:Chicken broth is the liquid base for this cream of broccoli soup. For a vegetarian option, substitute vegetable broth.</li>
            <li><b>Brocilli</b>:You can't have cream of broccoli soup without broccoli! Choose dark green broccoli with firm stems.</li>
            <li><b>Flour, milk and butter</b>:All-purpose flour, milk, and the rest of the butter are cooked together to create a roux. When added to the soup, it creates a thick and velvety texture that's impossible to resist.</li>
            <li><b>Pepper</b>:Ground black pepper is the perfect finishing touch. Add other spices and seasonings to taste.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sauté the onions and celery in butter until they're tender. Add the broccoli florets and the chicken broth, cover the pot, and simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>You can use a countertop blender or an immersion blender to purée the soup. Give it a few quick pulses, then blend continuously until the soup is totally smooth.</li>
            <li>Melt a few tablespoons of butter in a separate saucepan. Stir in the flour, then the milk. Cook the milk mixture until it's thick and bubbly, then add it to the soup. Finish it off with a dash of pepper (and the other seasonings of your choosing).</li>
